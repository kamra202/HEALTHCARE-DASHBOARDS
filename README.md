# Healthcare Analytics Power BI Dashboard

Welcome to the Patient Visit Dashboard project! As a Data Analyst, I meticulously crafted this insightful dashboard using Power BI, where dynamic calculations were performed, and a robust calendar table was created. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of patient satisfaction, wait time, and various key metrics related to patient visits.
